Allow installation of apps from other sources
==============

1. From the home screen of your device, tap on the Apps icon on the bottom, to open the apps panel.
2. Once inside the Settings app, scroll down through the options until you find the Security category under the Personal section.
> NOTE: On some custom Android implementations, like the one created by Xiaomi, the path you need to take is different: "Settings - >System -> Additional Settings -> Privacy."
3. Amongst the various security-related settings, the option that deals with the installation of apps using the sideload method is the Unknown sources option. Tap it to turn it on.
4. The system needs one final confirmation from you to make sure that this is indeed what you want. Read the warning and tap on OK to continue.
5. With this option turned on, you are now ready to install apps via the sideload method.
